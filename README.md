# fsevents_watcher
A python extension to gather events generated by the operating system (macOS) about a specific filesystem.
Have a look at `macos_watcher.py` for an example.

## bootstrap
```
# make sure you have set your GOPATH
brew install pkg-config golang
mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/nilleb
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nilleb
git clone https://github.com/nilleb/fsevents-watcher
./build.sh
# if you want to use this for your appengine dev_appserver.py
sudo python replace_mtime_file_watcher.py replace
```
now you can start `dev_appserver.py` as usual
